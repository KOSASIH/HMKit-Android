# HMKit Android

The HMKit Android SDK makes it easy to work with car data using the HIGH MOBILITY API platform. The SDK implements a strong security layer between your Android app and the platform while providing a straightforward native interface to read from, and write to, connected cars.
In addition, the SDK provides a UI component used to initate OAuth2 for the end-user in order to retrieve consent for the sharing of data.
