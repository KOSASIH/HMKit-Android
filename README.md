# HMKit Android

The HMKit Android SDK makes it easy to work with car data using the HIGH MOBILITY API platform. The SDK implements a strong security layer between your Android app and the platform while providing a straightforward native interface to read from, and write to, connected cars.
In addition, the SDK provides a UI component used to initate OAuth2 for the end-user in order to retrieve consent for the sharing of data.

### Requirements

* Android 5.0 Lollipop or higher. 
* For Bluetooth, chipset support for BLE peripheral mode. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26482611/chipsets-devices-supporting-android-5-ble-peripheral-mode https://altbeacon.github.io/android-beacon-library/beacon-transmitter-devices.html - list of some devices. 

### Getting Started

Get started with HMKit Android ðŸ“˜[browse the documentation](https://high-mobility.com/learn/tutorials/sdk/android/).

### Setup

* `git submodule update --init --recursive`
* import the Gradle project.
* Build HMKit Core:  
  * Install NDK through Android SDK Manager(Tools tab)
  * `cd hmkit-android/src/main/jni && ndk-build && cd -`
* Run the unit tests: `./gradlew test`
* If there are errors: Try `Gradle clean`, `File > Invalidate caches and restart`.
* Now **hm-android-basic-oauth** or **hm-android-bluetooth-auto-api-explorer** targets can be run with local code.

### Architecture

**General**: HMKit Android is a Java/Kotlin library that handles Bluetooth/Telematics connectivity. Security is implemented via JNI to the HMKit Core C module.

**hmkit-android**: Contains HMKit Android Java/Kotlin classes.

**hmkit-core-jni**: Contains JNI classes to HMKit Core.

**hmkit-crypto**: Contains necessary crypto classes and functions.

**hmkit-utils**: Contains general helper methods and classes.

**hm-android-basic-oauth** and **hm-android-bluetooth-auto-api-explorer**: Sample apps for testing.
